  Options

  -h | --help                       : Print this help message and exit.
  -v | --version                    : Print the OakPAL CLI version and exit.
  -j | --json                       : Write check reports in JSON format.
  -o | --outfile <outFile>          : Write check reports to the specified <outFile>
                                      instead of writing to stdout.
  -f | --opear-file <opearFile>     : Specify an OPEAR file to use (overrides $OAKPAL_OPEAR).
  -p | --plan <planName>            : Specify a different plan name to lookup in the specified opear.
                                      By default, the first plan exported by a specified opear will be used,
                                      or if no opear is specified, the basic oakpal plan will be used.
       --no-plan                    : Use no plan for the scan. Overrides the default behavior, which otherwise
                                      uses the oakpal core "basic-plan.json".
  -s | --severity-fail <severity>   : Exit with a non-zero code if any violations are
                                      reported with a severity level equal to or higher
                                      than <severity>. Can be MINOR, MAJOR, or SEVERE.
                                      If not specified, the default fail severity is MAJOR.
  <scanFile> [ <scanFile> ... ]     : Scan package files using the plan discovered on
                                      the $OAKPAL_PATH.

  Environment
  -----------
  OAKPAL_OPEAR  : Specify this variable to provide an OPEAR file/directory containing plans and checklist modules.
                  An OPEAR file is a JAR file constructed with the following Manifest headers, borrowed from OSGi:

                  Bundle-SymbolicName : This OSGi header is used for the opear cache key, and is required for the
                                        other headers should be recognized.
                  Bundle-Version      : This OSGi Manifest header is optional, and when present, used as part of the
                                        cache key.
                  Bundle-ClassPath    : This OSGi Manifest header specifies embedded JARs and directories that are
                                        added to the plan classpath. If not present, the default value of ".", or
                                        the root of the container, is added to the classpath.

                  When a path to a directory is specified using OAKPAL_OPEAR or -f/--opear-file, it will be treated
                  exactly as an extracted OPEAR archive, except for when it does not contain a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.
                  In that case, oakpal will look for a file in the root of the directory named "plan.json" to use
                  as the execution plan, or it will default to the oakpal basic plan.

  Exit Codes
  ----------
  0   : success
  1   : general error unrelated to scan execution
  9   : aborted scan
  10  : at least one SEVERE violation reported
  11  : at least one MAJOR violation reported (but no SEVERE violations)
  12  : at least one MINOR violation reported (but no MAJOR or SEVERE violations)
