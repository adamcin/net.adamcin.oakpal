  -h | --help                       : Print this help message and exit
  -v | --version                    : Print the OakPAL CLI version and exit

                                      $OAKPAL_PATH. By default, the first chart named

  -f | --fail-severity <severity>   : Exit with a non-zero code if any violations are

                                      than <severity>. Can be MINOR, MAJOR, or SEVERE.
                                      If not specified, the default fail severity is MAJOR.
  <scanFile> [ <scanFile> ... ]     : Scan package files using the chart discovered on

  Environment
  -----------
  OAKPAL_PATH                       : Specify this variable to provide OAR files/directories
                                      and additional OakPAL modules. This should be a colon-
                                      delimited (or semicolon-delimited on Windows) list of
                                      filesystem paths. Each element should be one of either:

                                          .oar files:     An OAR file is a JAR file constructed
                                                          with an "Oakpal-Class-Path" Manifest
                                                          header specifying embedded JARs and
                                                          directories to add to the scan
                                                          classpath.
                                          .jar files:     Other JAR files will simply be added
                                                          to the scan classpath.
                                          directories:    Directories in the OAKPAL_PATH will
                                                          be treated as expanded OAR files.
                                                          JARs located within a "lib" subfolder
                                                          will be added to the scan classpath.

                                      Additionally, the OAKPAL_PATH variable will be used to
                                      find the OakPAL Chart file to use for the scan.
                                      Each folder, JAR, or OAR file on OAKPAL_PATH will be
                                      inspected for an immediate child named "oakpal-chart.json",
                                      in the order specified in the variable, and the first
                                      found will be used.

  Exit Codes
  ----------
  0   : success
  1   : general error unrelated to scan execution
  9   : aborted scan
  10  : at least one SEVERE violation reported
  11  : at least one MAJOR violation reported (but no SEVERE violations)
  12  : at least one MINOR violation reported (but no MAJOR or SEVERE violations)
