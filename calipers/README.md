# OakPAL Caliper

The OakPAL Caliper is a content package that exercises all the features of the OakMachine and events handled by the 
ProgressCheck interface. It is published as an artifact in its own right so that it can be used as a standalone 
self-test for a configured instance of the CLI or Maven Plugin.
